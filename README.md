# Heart-Failure-Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CDVs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimate of 17.9 million each year which counts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Heart failure is a common cause of CVDs and can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tabaco use, unhealthy diet, physical activity and alcohol use.

## Data Source
